Example code for creating a system-friendly GadTools interface using Blitz Basic.

Code is in AmiBlitz3 format. This will also load into Blitz 2 without problems, but the resident files required will need to be manually added. Save from Blitz 2 as a .bb2 file instead to also save the resident file status.
